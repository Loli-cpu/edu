        <h2>Early Pioneers of Programming</h2>
        <p>
            The roots of programming date back to the early 19th century. The first concept of programming emerged with the invention of mechanical devices designed to automate tasks.
        </p>
        <h3>Ada Lovelace (1815–1852)</h3>
        <p>
            Ada Lovelace is considered the world’s first computer programmer. In 1843, she worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer. Ada wrote the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, which is why she is often celebrated as the first programmer. 
        </p>
        <h3>Charles Babbage (1791–1871)</h3>
        <p>
            Known as the "father of the computer," Charles Babbage designed the first automatic mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. Though it was never fully built during his lifetime, the design laid the groundwork for future computers.

        <h2>The Birth of Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
            Programming languages have developed over time to make coding more efficient, readable, and versatile. Here are some key milestones:
        </p>

        <h3>Assembly Language (1940s)</h3>
        <p>
            The first low-level programming language, Assembly, was used in early computers. It translates basic instructions into machine code that the computer's hardware can understand.
        </p>

        <h3>FORTRAN (1957)</h3>
        <p>
            Developed by IBM, FORTRAN (Formula Translation) is one of the oldest high-level programming languages. It was designed for scientific and engineering computations.
        </p>

        <h3>COBOL (1959)</h3>
        <p>
            COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) was created for business applications. Its design focuses on data processing and is still used in finance and administrative systems today.
        </p>

        <h3>C (1972)</h3>
        <p>
            Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, the C programming language is highly influential. It serves as the foundation for many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python.
        </p>

        <h3>Python (1991)</h3>
        <p>
            Python, created by Guido van Rossum, is a popular high-level language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, scientific computing, and data analysis.

        <h2>The Modern Era of Programming</h2>
        <p>
            Today, programming has evolved into a powerful tool shaping every aspect of our lives—from smartphones and artificial intelligence to video games and cloud computing. Modern developers use languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, and Swift to build everything from web applications to machine learning models.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the rise of open-source projects, communities worldwide contribute to evolving the tools and languages programmers use daily, making technology more accessible and customizable for various needs.

            <h2>The Early Pioneers of Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Programming has been at the core of technological advancements for centuries. It started with the invention of early computational machines, but the true pioneers of programming laid the groundwork for what we have today.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Alan Turing (1912–1954)</h3>
            <p>
                Alan Turing, often referred to as the father of computer science, is most famous for his work during World War II on breaking the German Enigma code. However, his most important contribution to programming was the development of the concept of the Turing Machine. This abstract machine could simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, and its principles underpin modern computing.
            </p>
    
            <h3>John von Neumann (1903–1957)</h3>
            <p>
                John von Neumann made critical contributions to computer architecture. His design, known as the "von Neumann architecture," is the blueprint for most modern computers. It introduced the concept of storing instructions (programs) in memory, which allowed computers to execute sequences of commands flexibly.
            </p>
        </section>
    
        <section id="evolution">
            <h2>The Evolution of Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>
                As computers evolved, so did the need for more human-readable languages. Early programming required detailed instructions that had to be translated into machine code, but programming languages made the process easier and faster.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Grace Hopper (1906–1992) and COBOL</h3>
            <p>
                Grace Hopper, a computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral, was a pioneer in developing programming languages. She invented the first compiler, which translated human-readable code into machine code. Her work led to the creation of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), a widely used language for business applications.
            </p>
    
            <h3>The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s)</h3>
            <p>
                By the 1970s, structured programming became the standard. This approach made code more organized and readable by using blocks, loops, and conditionals. Languages like C and Pascal became popular during this time, laying the foundation for object-oriented programming later on.
            </p>
        </section>
    
        <section id="modern">
            <h2>Modern Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Today, programming has expanded into many different fields, from web development to artificial intelligence. Some of the most popular modern languages include:
            </p>
    
            <h3>Java (1995)</h3>
            <p>
                Java revolutionized programming with its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. Its platform independence made it ideal for web applications, and it remains one of the most widely used programming languages globally.
            </p>
    
            <h3>JavaScript (1995)</h3>
            <p>
                Created by Brendan Eich, JavaScript was initially used to add interactive elements to web pages. Over time, it became the backbone of web development, powering both front-end and back-end applications through environments like Node.js.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Python (1991)</h3>
            <p>
                Python’s simplicity and versatility have made it one of the most popular programming languages in the world. From web development to data science and artificial intelligence, Python is often the go-to language for many fields.
